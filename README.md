### Original_Datasets
1. Preprocessed_Dataset: The preprocessed four datasets are provided, including the Llama version and the Vader version
2. Node_Mapping: The mapping file for transferring node id between original_id and mapped_id started from index 0 
3. Query_Nodes: Code, query nodes, and mapped query nodes are all provided

+ To protect user privacy, all user IDs in our datasets have been encoded.


### Representative_Algorithms
1. The links to all available codebases for representative algorithms can be found in the following table:
    | Type      | Algorithm | Title                                                                                            | Code   |

2. For each algorithm, only the revised scripts are provided to save space, with only the input and output changed
+ ALS: replace `qtcs.py` with `qtcs_batch.py`
+ WCF-CRC: replace `run.py` with `run_batch.py`
+ CSD: replace `Test.java` and `Config.java` with their revised updated version, replace `DataReader.java` with updated `DataReader.java` under the "util" folder
+ ST-Exa and Repeeling: No code has been changed, the commands to run the code are written in the corresponding `.bat` file for execution  
+ I2ACSM: All updated files are provided
+ TransZero_LS and TransZero_GS: all changed files and intermediate results are provided, the generation of .pt files is referred to the link: https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/2.6.1/get_started/introduction.html.


### Cohesiveness_Output
Due to the large space required by the original cohesiveness output files, which exceed 1 GB, only the condensed results (averaged results) generated by the `Condense_Results.py` script are provided. If you need the original cohesiveness output files, please contact the authors.
